# WhatsApp Chat Analysis Project
This project focuses on sentiment analysis techniques and is capable of analyzing any WhatsApp chats, whether they are group conversations or private messages.

#### **Note**
To ensure the best experience with this project, please follow these prerequisites:
- The chat data must be in text format.
- Currently, the project performs best with chat data in a 24-hour time format. Before exporting the chat data, ensure that the time format is set to 24-hour. (In the future, I plan to enhance the project to support 12-hour time format data with optimal performance.)

#### Project Strategy
- The project is designed using object-oriented principles to improve code readability and enhance understanding of functionality.
- It utilizes the Python framework Streamlit, which allows for the creation of interactive web applications with ease.
